# nf_cgn_sep20-EDA-project

The main focus of this project is exploratory data analysis. Using the King county Housing price data set we want to make recommandations for house buyers.  I took this opportunity to learn how to use and make different plots with plotly, matplotlib and seaborn. Finally, I used simple and multiple linear regression to model the prices. 


Note: The dataset used only contains information about house sales from 05/2014-05/2015.

The repository contains the following files:
  * King_County_House_prices_dataset.csv
    * dataset used
  * King_county_housing_eda_regression.ipynb
    * Jupyter notebook file containing the code
  * king_county_EDA.pdf
    * short presentation of main findings and recommendations for house buyers
